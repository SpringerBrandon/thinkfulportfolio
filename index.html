                I'm focusing on development with the intent on becoming one of the best in this field.  I'm highly motivated, deeply driven, and am able to look at things the way the consumer would.  This makes me ideal for roles working with both the consumer and with backend tech teams.

                Coding in general makes me feel awesome!  To be able to create something from scratch in general is pretty awesome so to be able to help people get a website up and running, write a script that helps automate some of their processes, or create a whole application that ties everything together is very satisfying.

              When I'm not building code, I'm usually building something else!  As stated above the satisfaction of making something is almost indescribable.  A few weeks ago we installed pavers on our back patio.  Pavers only have one purpose though and usually I try to do things that give a little less direction.  Because of that I like woodworking and a couple months ago I made this simple bed frame.
